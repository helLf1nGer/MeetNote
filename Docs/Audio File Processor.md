# Audio File Processor (file_processor.py)

This module provides utilities for processing audio and video files, including functionality to extract audio from video files.

## Functions

### process_file(file_path: str) -> str

Process the input file, extracting audio if necessary.

#### Parameters:
- `file_path` (str): The path to the input file.

#### Returns:
- str: The path to the processed audio file. If the input was already an audio file, this will be the same as the input path. If the input was a video file, this will be the path to the extracted audio file.

#### Raises:
- ValueError: If the input file type is not supported.

### _analyze_file(file_path: str) -> str

Analyze the input file and return its type.

#### Parameters:
- `file_path` (str): The path to the file to analyze.

#### Returns:
- str: The type of the file, either 'audio' or 'video'.

#### Raises:
- ValueError: If the file format is not supported.

### extract_audio(file_path: str) -> str

Extract audio from a video file to a temporary MP3 file.

#### Parameters:
- `file_path` (str): The path to the video file.

#### Returns:
- str: The path to the extracted audio file (MP3 format).

#### Raises:
- ffmpeg.Error: If there's an error during the audio extraction process.

## Usage Example

from audio.file_processor import process_file
